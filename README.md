## Project Title: **"Encrypted Real-Time Group Chat and File Sharing System"**

### Project Description:
Develop an **encrypted group chat application** where users can communicate with each other in real time over a network. The system will also support **private messages** and **file sharing** between clients, with basic encryption applied to secure the communication. This project will involve both the server and client implementations.

### Key Features:
1. **Group Chat Functionality**:
   - Clients can join a chat room by connecting to a central server.
   - Messages sent by one client are broadcasted to all other clients in the chat room.
   
2. **Private Messaging**:
   - Clients can send direct, private messages to other clients using a specific format (e.g., `@recipient:message`).
   - Only the intended recipient receives the message, keeping it private from other users.

3. **File Sharing**:
   - Clients can send image files directly to other clients.
   - The files will be transferred securely between clients and saved with the appropriate file extension.

4. **Basic Message Encryption**:
   - Messages exchanged between clients (both public and private) are encrypted using XOR encryption before being transmitted over the network. This adds a basic level of security to prevent message interception.

5. **Client Nicknames**:
   - Clients must choose a nickname upon connecting to the server. This nickname is used to identify users in the chat and is displayed with each message.

6. **Client Connection Management**:
   - The server can handle multiple clients (up to 10 in this example).
   - If a client disconnects, a message is broadcasted to all other clients to notify them.

### Project Deliverables:
- A **server** application that manages incoming client connections, broadcasts messages, and handles file transfers.
- A **client** application that allows users to send/receive messages and files.
- Proper documentation explaining the setup process, encryption methods, and how the different components work together.

### Technologies:
- **C** for system-level socket programming and file handling.
- **XOR encryption** for basic message security (can be enhanced).
- **TCP/IP** for reliable communication between clients and the server.
- Optional GUI: **Qt**, **GTK**, or **Tkinter**.

### Real-World Applications:
- This project can serve as a learning tool for understanding network programming, encryption, and file transfer protocols.
- With improvements, it could evolve into a small-scale secure messaging platform for private groups or companies.

This project would be great for showcasing practical skills in **network programming**, **security**, and **file handling** in C, with possibilities for further development.
